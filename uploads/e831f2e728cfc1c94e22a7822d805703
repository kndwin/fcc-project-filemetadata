> I've been thinking about ministry for pre-school and there's like a few 
> major themes I want to touch base on, I want to think about three main areas
1. Theological feast
2. Pastoral love
3. Adminstrative oil

## 1. Theological feast
> "Jesus, however, invited them: "Let the little children come to me, and don't 
> stop them, because the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell
> you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will
> never enter it".

I wonder if children are indeed the true disciples of the written Word. Wisdom
flows in their vein and theologically they have the clearest understanding of
what Scripture has to offer. Simply because children excels in monotony and 
can be in love with one fragment of a whole. They're truly expressive of what
captures them and shy not from bearing their hearts.

Scripture then must meet children at the heart. Hard work must be taken to 
ensure Scripture in its depth and entirety is presented like a lamp on top of
a hill. I'm convinced the product is not as critical as the process. If we rely
on the author of life to move our teaching, then what the Spirit teaches will
no doubt be better than our own. The challenge that presents itself is what 
does it mean to rely on God as we work hard on the Scriptures? I guess the 
obvious answer is that the Scripture must first be deep in our hearts. Heart 
lessons are not taught but caught. If the Scripture holds little power in our 
own hearts, then we have not understood it. If it does not sway our soul to 
weep at the preciousness of grace then we need to be taught by it first. 
We must work hard at falling in love with the Scriptures, teaching then will 
come as naturally as breathing.

## 2. Pastoral love

> "And if I donate all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body in
> order to boast but do not have love, I gain nothing"



## 3. Administrative oil

This theme is more so on the gifts that God has bestow as my portion. I love 
effiency. Making 5 clicks down to 3 really brings life to my eyes. In this 
light, I have a few changes I'd like to propose.

I'm thinking as a team, we should have a getaway and plan for a whole year the 
inner workings of what we'll like to do for preschool

I'd also like to play around with communication and technology to further 
finetune how we communicate and do things. The perfect goal is that we don't
even have to think about how to upload a file, or how to reach out to the team,
because we're so used to doing it.
