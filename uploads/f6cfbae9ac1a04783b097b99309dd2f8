## Marking Rubric
### Part A and Part B
#### Demonstrate attainment of Engineers Australia's Stage 1 Competencies
Provide information about role undertaken, and specific examples of tasks
that were performed during each industrial placement

The examples provided clearly exemplify multiple indicators of attainment 
from Tabe 1 and Table 2 of Engineers Australia's Stage 1 Competencies 
document, with at least 5 Attainment in total.

#### Transfer
The provided examples demonstrates the student's abilities to **adapt and 
apply** engineering skills, ablilities, theories, or methedologies to 
**unfamiliar situations** during the industrial placement and **solve difficult
and interlinked problems or explores complex issues in original ways**

#### Integrated Communication
Completes the industrial training report in the required format

The example is written in a manner that connects accurately and explicity the 
role undertaken and the tasks that were performed during each industrial 
placement with the indicators of attainment: i.e. the student has a good 
awareness of the report's purpose and audience.

### Part C
#### Connections to Experience
**Compares and contrast** industrial placement experiences and academic 
knowledge, and **illuminate** differences, as well as similarities, between 
former and the later. The student also demonstrates **deep understanding** of
fields of study and broaden own points of view due to the industrial placement
experience.

*Example*
At univeristy I had group-based assignments. During my industrial placement at
PSI, I was a member of an international team that consisted of a PhD student 
and his supervisor, who were both Swiss-German physcist, and two engineer from 
France and Italy

A key difference between group-based assignment at university and teamwork in
the workplace is the composition of my team members. At university, my group
consist of my classmates only. My team at the workplace composed of individuals
from difference disciplines and age groups (21 to 45) and cultural background

Working in a multi-discipline team made me realised how a team that possess a 
wide range of profressional competencies is more fully equipped to meet a wide 
range of challenges, and how good communication is essential to the success of 
the team.

I had to write a research plan in one of my course (CEIC4002) after my industry
placement. I realised how a well written research plan can serve as an effective
communication tool of setting and prioritising goals, as well as degine the 
roles and responsibilities of each team member.

#### Reflection and Self-Assessment
**Evaluates** changes in learning before and after each industrial placement, 
recognizing complex contextual factors (e.g. works with ambiguity and risk, 
deal with frustration). **demonstrate self-awareness** and **envisions** a 
future self or **develop** plans that build on experiences or learning from 
each industrial placement.

*Example*
Working in a team during my industrial placement made me realise how I was 
unprepared for it.

At univestiy, my lecturer had stressed the importance of good communicate in
group work, but I was never taught or made aware of what good communication
in a team setting actually entails. For example, I frequently wrote emails 
that had incomplete information. 

In the future, I will made an effort to learn how to communicate more 
effectively and professionally, starting with taking a course on business
communication in March.

## Part A: Description of Placements
I am working at Appian as an Associate Solution Engineer. My role commence on
17/01/2020 and presently I am employed full-time.

What is Appian? At a high level, Appian provides a platform that includes a
range of tools to enable rapid development of enterprise level 
applications. These tools can be categorized into 3 main components. The first
being a low-code programming platform called SAIL, the second is being able to
securely integrate data from multiple sources with Appian Cloud and the final 
component uses automation scripts called Appian RPA.

At a lower level, Appian's ultises the following stack to achieve the above. 
On the front-end, Appian offers a WYSIWYG interface that gets rendered through
React. On top of this, there exist multiple integrations that adds extra 
functionality and features.
On the back-end, Appian uses K engines to process work sent through the 
application server Tomcat. To sync these engines, Appian developed a technology
called Service Manager that makes sures the K engines are
, Apache Kafka is ultised to persist all transactions
On the infrastructure level

As a Solution Engineer, my core responsiblities can be summarised into three 
main areas. This includes troubleshoot cases
- Troubleshoot cases
- help 


## Part B: Indicators of Attainment

Issue: 
- A client reported a case where they have
Approach
- Reviewed 2 logs, time stamps, implications, 
Result
- Client was satisfied with the result and was able to identify where the 
  main issue was


## Part C: Reflection on Learning and Workpace Experience

- Initiative 
  
  Taking initiative requires effective communication and decision making.
  Whilst working at my role, there's been multiple instances where opportunities
  to take charge of a situation arised. I learnt that in a work context, taking
  initiative requires a set of communicational skills.
  For example, at work. There are levels of prioritise that get assigned to 
  cases. This ranges from Critical (P1) to Low (P4). When a Critical case comes
  in, taking initiative is imperitive as there are multiple priortises that has
  to be resolved in a timely manner. This includes responding to the cases, 
  reviewing the neccessary information, notifying relevant members of the team 
  and drafting an incident report. All of these task require initiative as 
  being a responder, you'll contain the most context which would enable you to 
  make the most informed decisions. As a result, this situation has taught me
  to take initiative by making quick informed decisions, communicate effectively
  and prioritise competing tasks. 

  In comparision to university, taking initiatives for group projects involved a 
  slightly different challenges. This was because in university, the 
  responsiveness
